# Milestone-Project-3

## Short Description
3rd and final capstone project for my Python Bootcamp.

## Initial Idea
~~Event Scheduler and Calendar - Make an application which allows the user to enter a date and time of an event, event notes and then schedule those events on a calendar. The user can then browse the calendar or search the calendar for specific events. Optional: Allow the application to create re-occurrence events that reoccur every day, week, month, year etc.~~

Create bot that goes to [r/MechanicalKeyboards][r/mk] and checks all posts (e.g. once a day) for 'giveaway' in the title. 

When there is, send links to me in an email.

## Motivation
Allows me to get an update every day to see if there are any new posts indicating a giveaway. Within the email, a link will be provided leading to the original post. This will allow me to make my comment and enter the giveaway.

## Additional Functionality
* Currently cannot be automated as email requires login. Need to find a way to automate this process.
* Expand functionality to include [r/MechanicalKeyboardsUK][r/mkuk]
* Turn it into a fullstack project by introducing a UI, having a way to store the emails in a database.
  * Find a way to integrate multiple things into the UI (e.g. pick which subreddit to search, pick keywords, pick how often the check runs)
* Emailchimp for managing emails
