# Milestone-Project-3

## Short Description
3rd and final capstone project for my Python Bootcamp.

## Initial Idea
~~Event Scheduler and Calendar - Make an application which allows the user to enter a date and time of an event, event notes and then schedule those events on a calendar. The user can then browse the calendar or search the calendar for specific events. Optional: Allow the application to create re-occurrence events that reoccur every day, week, month, year etc.~~

Create bot that goes to [r/MechanicalKeyboards][r/mk] and checks all posts (e.g. once a day) for 'giveaway' in the title. 

When there is, send links to me in an email.

## Additional Functionality
* Expand functionality to include [r/MechanicalKeyboardsUK][r/mkuk]
